i recently graduated from the university of michigan college of engineering with a bse in computer science. i'm from the bronx, new york, and i love math and computers.

during my time at umich, i made the dean's list, and received university honors. i was actively involved in campus life, participating in michigan hacker, msa, asa, bsa, lsa, and the trading club.

my coursework covered a wide range of topics in computer science and engineering, including:

- computer organization
- data structures and algorithms
- compiler construction
- computer networks
- human-centered software design

i also delved into mathematics and signal processing, studying linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and digital signal processing. my passion for ai/ml led me to explore natural language processing, machine learning theory, and computer vision.

Always open to new ideas, feel free to reach out to me at tajuarb[at]umich[dot]edu.
